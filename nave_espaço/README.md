# Computação Gráfica - 3D Project

This project is a 3D solar system and spaceship simulation using the [three.js](https://threejs.org/) library. It features interactive navigation, textured planets, and dynamic collisions.

## Features
- 3D solar system with textured, cubic planets
- Realistic orbits and self-rotation for each planet
- Planets with rings (Saturn, Jupiter) have extra cubic details and ring structures
- Spaceship with blocky design and animated propellers
- Collision detection between the ship and planets (planets leave orbit on collision)
- Lighting, shadows, and grid for spatial reference
- Responsive camera following the ship

## Demo & Tutorials
- [Three.js tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7AOvWpIVHU)
- [Three.js example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jP4xpga6yY)

## Commands
   - **W/S**: Forward/Backward
   - **A/D**: Turn Left/Right
   - **Shift**: Boost
   - **Arrow Up/Down**: Move Up/Down

## Dependencies
- [three.js](https://threejs.org/) (included in the project)
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) (for future animations, not required to run basic project)

## Future Ideas / To-Do
- Add more spaceship animations (using GSAP)
- Improve planet and ring visuals
- Add sound effects and music
- Implement more advanced collision effects
- Add UI for selecting planets or changing camera modes
